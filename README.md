# HabitHaven 

## Overview

The ability to form good habits is integral. HabitHaven is an application that 
aids users in forming good habits.  

## Target Audience

My application is meant for anyone desiring to transform their life by forming good
habits.

## Features
- Create and manage a list of habits
- Customize a habit by frequency - daily, weekly, or monthly
- Customizable notifications - users receive customizable reminders for each habit
- Gamify habit formation
  - Badges for achieving streaks
- Ability to view in-depth statistics for a specific habit (completion rate, number of 
completions, etc.)
- Ability to see graphs of habit statistics and trends over time
## Personal Significance
 This project is of interest to me as a student interested in growth. Even now, I can 
 think of many small habits that I can strive for. An app would help organize the 
 habit formation process, bringing the user one step closer to transforming their
 life.
