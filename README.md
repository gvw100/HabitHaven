# HabitHaven 

## Overview

The ability to form good habits is integral. HabitHaven is an application that 
aids users in forming good habits.  

## Target Audience

My application is meant for anyone desiring to transform their life by forming good
habits.

## Potential Features
- Create and manage a list of habits
- Customize a habit by frequency - daily, weekly, or custom
- Customizable notifications - users receive customizable reminders for each habit
- Gamify habit formation
  - Badges for achieving streaks
- Option to view in-depth statistics for a specific habit (completion rate, number of 
completions, etc.)
- Optional additional notifications of recent milestones to keep morale high
## Personal Significance
 This project is of interest to me as a student interested in growth. Even now, I can 
 think of many small habits that I can strive for. An app would help organize the 
 habit formation process, bringing the user one step closer to transforming their
 life.
 ## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a habit to my list of habits and specify the
name, frequency/period, and description. 
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a habit as complete for a specific time. (eg: 
I did 20 push-up successfully at 8 am)
- As a user, I want to be able to view my streak so far for each habit.
  - For now, I think streaks will be defined in terms of the cycle period. For
  example, if someone wants to read twice per week, their streak would be three if 
  this was done successfully for three weeks. 
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all my active habits.
- As a user, I want to be able to customize notification reminders for each habit.
